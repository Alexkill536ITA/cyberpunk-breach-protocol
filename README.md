# Cyberpunk Hexcode Breach

### Description:

This is a fun made replica of the Breach protocol minigame from Cyberpunk 2077速 owned by CD Project Red速.
The repilica was made based on version 2.0 of the original game and tries to be as faithful to the original as possible.
This project was born with the purpose of creating a tool that would be training for digital gaming and to be used in Cyberpunk 2020速 and Cyberpunk RED速 role-playing game campaigns as well.
